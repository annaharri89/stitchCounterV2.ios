# stitchCounterV2.ios
A modern iOS app for counting stitches with support for multiple themes and color schemes. This is being ported over from an android version I created. Here is the link to it: [Stitch Counter](https://github.com/annaharri89/stitchCounterV2)

## Features (Work in Progress)

- Single and Double counter project modes for tracking stitches and/or rows
- Library system to save counters and return to them later.
- Three different customizable color themes. The theme selection changes the app icon. Light and Dark mode also supported.
- Responsive design for all device sizes using Swift UI. Optimized for portrait and landscape orientations.
- The user can upload up to 10 photos to each project. Photos are saved to the device's file system.
- An import/export library feature to backup your library of projects since the app storage is local to your device and not uploaded to any cloud based service.
- Stitch Counter does not collect analytics, tracking data, or personal information. All data is stored locally on the user’s device.
